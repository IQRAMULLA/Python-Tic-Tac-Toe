This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python's Tkinter library, offering a fun and interactive way to play the classic two-player game. The game features a clean and user-friendly interface where Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) can take turns by clicking on a 3x3 grid. The program automatically checks for winning combinations after every turn and announces the winner or declares a draw if all slots are filled. Players can reset the game at any time using the reset button to start a new match. With its straightforward design and functionality, this project is ideal for beginners learning Python GUI development or anyone looking to enjoy a quick game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
